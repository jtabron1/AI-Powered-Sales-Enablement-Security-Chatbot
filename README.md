## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How accurate are the answers?**  
A: The AI retrieves information directly from your documentation, ensuring high accuracy. It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which means it only answers based on what's in your uploaded documents—it doesn't make things up.

**Q: What if the AI doesn't know the answer?**  
A: If the information isn't in your knowledge base, the AI will indicate it cannot find the answer rather than guessing. This is a safety feature of RAG systems.

**Q: Can it answer questions in different languages?**  
A: Yes, Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports multiple languages. However, your source documents should be in the same language as the questions for best results.

**Q: How long does initial setup take?**  
A: Setup takes 15-20 minutes. Document indexing depends on volume—typically 5-10 documents can be processed in under a minute.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Do I need to be technical to use this?**  
A: No. Sales reps simply chat with the bot. n8n provides a user-friendly chat interface. Some technical knowledge is helpful for initial setup.

**Q: Can I use my own AI model instead of Claude?**  
A: Yes, n8n supports multiple AI providers. The workflow can be modified to use OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or other models.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**  
A: Costs depend on usage:
- Pinecone: Free tier covers most startups (up to 100K vectors)
- OpenAI embeddings: ~$0.0001 per 1K tokens (very cheap)
- Claude API: ~$0.003 per 1K input tokens
- Total: Typically $20-50/month for small-medium teams

**Q: What file formats are supported?**  
A: PDF, Word (.docx), plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md), and other common document formats.

**Q: How do I update the knowledge base?**  
A: Simply add or update files in your Google Drive folder. The workflow automatically detects changes and updates the vector database.

### Business Questions

**Q: Will this replace our security team?**  
A: No—it augments them. The AI handles repetitive questions, freeing your security team to focus on strategic work, threat analysis, and complex customer concerns.

**Q: What if a customer asks something very specific?**  
A: The AI answers what it can from documentation. For edge cases, sales reps still escalate to security—but 80% of questions can be answered instantly.

**Q: Can we customize the AI's tone or style?**  
A: Yes. You can provide instructions to the AI agent (in n8n) to adjust tone, formality, level of detail, etc.

**Q: Is this compliant with our legal/security policies?**  
A: You control what documents the AI accesses. Only upload approved, customer-facing materials. The AI doesn't access anything else.

**Q: How do we prevent the AI from sharing confidential info?**  
A: Only upload documents that are approved for customer sharing. Use sanitized versions of reports (e.g., remove client names from SOC 2 reports). Never upload internal-only documentation.

**Q: Can multiple team members use it simultaneously?**  
A: Yes, the chat interface supports multiple concurrent users. Each user has their own conversation thread.

### Integration Questions

**Q: Can it integrate with our CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot)?**  
A: Yes, with additional n8n configuration. You can log questions asked, track which prospects need security info, etc.

**Q: Can it be embedded in our website?**  
A: The n8n chat interface can be embedded via iframe or accessed via API for custom integrations.

**Q: Does it work with Slack or Teams?**  
A: Yes, with additional configuration. You can add Slack/Teams triggers to make the bot available in those platforms.

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Document Preparation
1. **Start with your most common questions**: Upload FAQ documents first
2. **Use clear, concise documents**: Better source material = better answers
3. **Keep documents updated**: Set a quarterly review schedule
4. **Remove outdated info**: Delete superseded policies or expired certificates

### Usage Guidelines
1. **Train your sales team**: Show them how to ask effective questions

4. **Monitor usage**: Track which questions are asked most frequently

### Maintenance
